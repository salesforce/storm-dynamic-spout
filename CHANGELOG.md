### Bug Fixes

sideline is active for firehose.

### Removed
##### Kafka Consumer
- [PR-31](https://github.com/salesforce/storm-dynamic-spout/pull/31) Removed configuration items: `spout.kafka
.autocommit` and `spout.kafka.autocommit_interval_ms`.  This functionality is covered by configuration item `spout.coordinator.consumer_state_flush_interval_ms`

## 0.8.x
- Split the dynamic spout framework into `com.salesforce.storm.spout.dynamic`.
  - Anyone implementing a `DynamicSpout` will need to update package names.
- Checkstyle is enforced everywhere now.

## 0.7.x
- Simplified triggers, new singular and cleaner interface for implementing.

## 0.6.x
- MetricsRecorder is now a required dependency for VirtualSpout instances.

## 0.5.x
- Restructured config.

## 0.4.x
The goal of this release was to split off the sideline specific code from the dynamic spout framework such that it can be reused in other projects. 
- DynamicSpout is no longer an abstract class, now it can be attached directly to Storm as is.
- SidelineSpout does nothing other than change configuration, specifically setting the handler classes.
- SpoutHandler is a new way to define methods to tie into the DynamicSpout lifecycle.
- VirtualSpoutHandler is a new way to define methods to tie into the VirtualSpout lifecycle.
- New sidelining tests that are leaner and faster.
- Renamed SidelineSpoutConfig to SpoutConfig and changed the sideline_spout.* keys to spout.*, the sideline specific ones have been renamed to just sideline.*
- SpoutConfig uses a new annotation for config, and there's a new script to auto-generate the markdown table for it.

## 0.3.x
- Renamed and reorganized classes to separate kafka specific implementation details

## 0.2.x
- `SidelineRequest`'s now include the `SidelineIdentifier` which can now be explicitly supplied.  The original constructor that generated a UUID is now deprecated. 

## 0.1.x
- Initial release!
